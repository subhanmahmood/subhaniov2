# Quote Management System Action Plan

## Epic 1: Lead Management (34 points)

### 1. Enhance Lead Inbox Page (13 points)

**Description:** Create a detailed view for individual leads and implement navigation from the lead list to this view. This enhancement will include a comprehensive display of lead information, including contact details, interaction history, and associated documents. The new lead detail page will also feature quick action buttons for common tasks such as creating a quote or updating lead status.

**Reason:** To provide a comprehensive overview of each lead and improve lead management efficiency. This detailed view will allow sales representatives to quickly access all relevant information about a lead in one place, reducing the time spent switching between different screens or systems. It will also enable more informed decision-making and personalized communication with potential clients.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am on the lead list page
  When I click on a lead
  Then I should be navigated to a detailed view of that lead

- Given I am on the lead detail page
  When I view the page
  Then I should see all relevant lead information

- Given I am on the lead detail page
  When I click a "back to list" button
  Then I should be navigated back to the lead list page

- Given I am on the lead detail page
  When I click a "create quote" button
  Then I should be navigated to a quote builder page

- Given I am on the quote builder page
  When I click a "save draft" button
  Then the current state of the quote should be saved without finalizing it 

**Files to modify:**
- `src/components/admin/lead-list.tsx`
- `src/app/admin/leads/[id]/page.tsx` (new file)
- `src/components/admin/lead-detail.tsx` (new file)

### 2. Implement Lead Status Tracking (8 points)

**Description:** Add a status field to leads on the lead list page and the ability to update it. This feature will include a predefined set of status options (e.g., New, Contacted, Qualified, Proposal Sent, Negotiating, Won, Lost) and the ability to move leads through these stages. The status will be visually represented in both the lead list and detail views, with color-coding for quick identification.

**Reason:** To track the progress of leads through the sales pipeline. Implementing lead status tracking will provide a clear visual representation of where each lead stands in the sales process. This will help sales teams prioritize their efforts, identify bottlenecks in the sales pipeline, and provide more accurate sales forecasting. It will also facilitate better communication within the team about the state of each potential deal.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am viewing the lead list
  When I look at a lead entry
  Then I should see its current status

- Given I am on the lead detail page
  When I select a new status from a dropdown
  Then the lead's status should update in the database

- Given I have updated a lead's status
  When I return to the lead list
  Then I should see the updated status reflected in the list

**Files to modify:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `src/components/admin/lead-list.tsx`
- `src/components/admin/lead-detail.tsx`
- `src/server/actions/lead.actions.ts`

## Epic 2: Quote Management (21 points)

### 4. Enhance Quote Builder (13 points)

**Description:** Improve the existing quote builder with additional features and optimizations. This enhancement will include the ability to save drafts, duplicate existing quotes, and preview quotes before sending. The quote builder will also feature a more intuitive user interface with drag-and-drop functionality for adding and rearranging line items, as well as real-time calculation of totals and discounts.

**Reason:** To streamline the quote creation process and improve accuracy. An enhanced quote builder will reduce the time and effort required to create professional, accurate quotes. The ability to save drafts will prevent loss of work and allow for collaboration on complex quotes. Duplication of existing quotes will speed up the process for similar deals, while the preview feature will help catch any errors before sending to the client. These improvements will lead to faster quote turnaround times and a higher quality of output.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am creating a new quote
  When I click a "Save Draft" button
  Then the current state of the quote should be saved without finalizing it

- Given I have an existing quote
  When I select an option to duplicate it
  Then a new quote should be created with the same details as the original

- Given I am editing a quote
  When I click a "Preview" button
  Then I should see a preview of how the quote will appear to the client

**Files to modify:**
- `src/components/collab/collab-form-container.tsx`
- `src/server/actions/quote.actions.ts` (new file)

### 5. Quote Approval Workflow (8 points)

**Description:** Implement a workflow for quote approval and client communication. This system will include automated email notifications at various stages of the quote lifecycle, a client-facing portal for reviewing and responding to quotes, and an internal approval process for quotes above a certain value threshold. The workflow will also track the history of changes and communications related to each quote.

**Reason:** To formalize the quote approval process and improve client interaction. A structured quote approval workflow will ensure consistency in how quotes are handled, reduce the chances of quotes being forgotten or overlooked, and provide a clear audit trail of all interactions. The client-facing portal will make it easier for clients to review and respond to quotes, potentially speeding up the decision-making process. This system will also help maintain professionalism in client communications and reduce the likelihood of miscommunications or lost information.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a quote has been created
  When I change its status (e.g., to "Sent")
  Then the system should send an appropriate email notification to the client

- Given I am a client
  When I receive a quote for review
  Then I should be able to approve, reject, or request changes through a client-facing page

- Given a client has provided feedback on a quote
  When I view the quote in the admin interface
  Then I should see the client's feedback and be able to make necessary adjustments

**Files to modify:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `src/server/actions/quote.actions.ts`
- `src/app/client/quote/[id]/page.tsx` (new file)
- `src/lib/email.ts` (new file for email functionality)

## Epic 3: Contract Management (34 points)

### 6. Contract Template System (13 points)

**Description:** Create a system for managing and customizing contract templates. This system will include a library of standard contract templates, a template editor with version control, and the ability to insert dynamic fields that can be populated with client-specific information. The system will also support the creation of modular contract sections that can be mixed and matched to create custom contracts.

**Reason:** To standardize contract creation and reduce manual work. A robust contract template system will ensure consistency across all contracts, reducing the risk of errors or omissions that could lead to legal issues. It will significantly speed up the contract creation process, allowing sales representatives to quickly generate professional contracts tailored to each client's needs. The version control feature will help track changes over time and ensure that only the most up-to-date templates are used.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am an admin
  When I access the contract template section
  Then I should be able to create, edit, and delete contract templates

- Given I am editing a contract template
  When I add variable placeholders
  Then these placeholders should be correctly processed when generating a contract

- Given I have made changes to a contract template
  When I save those changes
  Then the system should create a new version of the template while preserving the old one

**Files to modify:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `src/app/admin/contracts/templates/page.tsx` (new file)

### 7. Contract Generation Process (21 points)

**Description:** Implement the conversational process for combining and customizing contracts. This process will guide users through a series of questions to determine which contract sections are needed, resolve any conflicts between chosen sections, and customize the language based on specific deal parameters. The system will also include a clause library for quick insertion of standard or custom clauses.

**Reason:** To create flexible, tailored contracts efficiently. A guided contract generation process will enable non-legal staff to create complex, customized contracts without the need for extensive legal knowledge. This will reduce the workload on the legal team and speed up the contract creation process. The system's ability to handle conflicts and customize language will ensure that the resulting contracts are coherent and properly tailored to each specific deal, reducing the risk of disputes or misunderstandings later in the process.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am generating a new contract
  When I select multiple contract templates
  Then the system should guide me through a step-by-step process to combine them

- Given I am combining contract templates
  When there are conflicting clauses
  Then the system should prompt me to choose which clause to use or how to resolve the conflict

- Given I have completed the contract generation process
  When I click to finalize the contract
  Then the system should generate a formatted PDF of the contract

- Given I have generated a contract
  When I click the preview button
  Then I should see how the contract will appear in its final form before finalizing

**Files to modify:**

- `src/server/actions/contract.actions.ts`

## Epic 4: Client Portal (21 points)

### 8. Client Authentication System (13 points)

**Description:** Implement an email-based authentication system for client access. This system will use secure, time-limited tokens sent via email for authentication, eliminating the need for password management. It will include features such as multi-factor authentication for high-security accounts, session management with automatic timeouts, and detailed access logging for security audits.

**Reason:** To provide secure access for clients to view their quotes, contracts, and project status. An email-based authentication system offers a balance between security and user convenience. It eliminates the risks associated with weak or reused passwords while providing a familiar and straightforward login process for clients. The additional security features will help protect sensitive client information and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am a client
  When I enter my email address on the sign-in page
  Then I should receive an email with a sign-in link

- Given I have received a sign-in email
  When I click the link
  Then I should be securely logged into the client portal

- Given I am a client who has forgotten my password
  When I request a password reset
  Then I should receive an email with instructions to reset my password

- Given I am logged in as a client

This dashboard will provide a centralized location for clients to access all their project-related information, including active quotes, contracts, invoices, and project status updates. It will feature a timeline of project milestones, a messaging system for direct communication with the project team, and the ability to upload and share documents.

**Reason:** To provide clients with easy access to their project details and improve transparency. A comprehensive client dashboard will enhance the client experience by giving them instant access to all relevant information about their projects. This transparency can help build trust and reduce the number of status update requests that the team has to handle manually. The messaging feature will streamline communication and create a clear record of all project-related discussions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am logged in as a client
  When I access my dashboard
  Then I should see an overview of my active quotes, contracts, and project status

- Given there is an update to my project
  When I log into my dashboard
  Then I should see a notification about the update

- Given I am viewing my project details
  When I want to communicate with the admin
  Then I should be able to send a message or comment through the dashboard

**Files to modify:**

It will also include features such as recurring invoices for subscription-based services, partial payment handling, and multi-currency support.

**Reason:** To automate the invoicing process and provide secure payment options for clients. Integrating with Stripe will streamline the entire invoicing and payment process, reducing manual work and the potential for errors. It will provide clients with a professional and secure payment experience, potentially leading to faster payments. The automatic reconciliation of payments will improve financial tracking and reporting, while features like recurring invoices and multi-currency support will accommodate a wider range of business models and international clients.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given an approved quote
  When I generate an invoice
  Then it should automatically create a corresponding invoice in Stripe

- Given I am a client viewing an invoice
  When I choose to pay the invoice
  Then I should be directed to a secure Stripe payment page

- Given a client has made a payment through Stripe
  When the payment is processed
  Then the system should automatically update the invoice status and notify the admin

- Given I am an admin
