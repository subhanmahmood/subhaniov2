# Project Notes

## Current Flow
1. Client emails requesting a price for X
2. Process is tedious:
   - Difficult to elicit exact requirements
   - Challenging to map client needs to our offering
3. Email communication lacks professionalism

## Proposed Flow (v1)
1. Client emails requesting a price for X
2. Forward email to lead inbox
3. Email is processed and offer is built with product details from DB
4. Send quote to client using React email template
5. Further dialog occurs via email
6. Ability to amend the final quote via admin panel and send to client

## Quote Tracking
Quotes will be tracked in a custom basic CRM with the following states:
1. INITIAL ENQUIRY RECEIVED VIA EMAIL
2. QUOTE SENT FROM APP
3. NEGOTIATION STAGE (via email)
4. FINAL QUOTE SENT FROM APP
5. QUOTE ACCEPTED
6. CONTRACT SENT FROM APP
7. CONTRACT SIGNED 
8. DRAFT UPLOADED TO APP
9. DRAFT ACCEPTED BY CLIENT
   - If not accepted: REVISIONS REQUESTED
   - Then: REVISIONS SENT
   - Then: REVISIONS ACCEPTED
10. PROJECT SIGNED OFF
11. INVOICE SENT
12. INVOICE PAID
